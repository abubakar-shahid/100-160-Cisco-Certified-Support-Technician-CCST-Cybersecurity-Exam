# üöÄ 7-Day Study Plan

## üîë Strategy

* **Core Topics First** ‚Üí Focus on domains with higher weight: *Security Principles, Threats, Network Security*.
* **Practice Daily** ‚Üí Use ‚ÄúDo I Know This Already?‚Äù quizzes + flashcards.
* **Revision End** ‚Üí Last 2 days = full mock exams + weak areas.

---

## üìÖ Day-by-Day Plan
